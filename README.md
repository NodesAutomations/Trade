# Why learning pineScript is important?
- main goal is develop my own custom script to simplify and speed up my daily tasks like screening and decision making during live market
- remove dependency on third party indicator because they can go out of support or sometime you have no idea what's happening behind code. I also want to remove unwanted stuff from other third party indicators
- making all indicator with my default settings this will make adding or removing scrip much easier, i can take full advantage of trading view
